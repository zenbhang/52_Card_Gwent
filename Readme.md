##Introduction

The game of *Spies and Medics* is a card game that takes influence from many historical and contemporary sources. From archaic *War* to modern *Witcher 3*, the card game is a weird amalgamated love child and homage to old fashioned and new card games.

##Rules

###General

In order to play this game, you need:

* 2 players

* a deck of 52 cards (A-K, no jokers)

###Gameplay

* each player is given 10 cards

* each player has 2 lanes, one for red cards and the other for black cards

* a player must win two out of three rounds in order to win a match

* rounds and matches can end in a draw

* at the beginning of the game players should flip a coin to determine a winner, who is going to draft the first card, and a loser who is going to start the game

###Phases

Coin Flip -> Draft Phase -> Turn Phase

###Drafting

As determined by the coin flip, whoever drafts first must discard a card from their hand and draw a new card from the deck. After doing so, the other player discards their card and draws a new one from the deck.

This process should be repeated until both players have discarded 2 cards each. All discarded cards in the drafting phase should go into the side pile.

Once the drafting phase is completed, the first turn can begin.

###Rounds

The player who drafted second should play the first card. On every turn, a player can decide whether to play a card or to pass their turn.

If a player passes their turn, they won't be able to put down a card until the next round. The remaining player can play as many cards as they want until they also pass. Each round is concluded when both players pass their turn.

The winner of each round is a player with the highest amount of points.

At the beginning of the second round, the winning player can draw 2 cards while their opponent can draw only 1 card.

If the second round does not end the match, a player who wins the second round can draw 3 cards while their opponent draws 2 cards. If the second round ends in a draw, both players draw 2 cards each.

At the end of the third round all cards on each player's side of the field go into their respective discard piles, regardless of original ownership.

The score is set to 0 for both players at the beginning of each round.

All modifiers and side cards go to the side pile.

Players should take turns when starting a new round.

##Cards
* **Aces** - Modifiers

* **2**- Modifiers

* **3**- Nullifiers

* **4 -> 10** - Value Cards

* **J and K** - Spies (draw 1, has a value of 5 points and is placed in the opponents field, as well as adding to your opponent's current round score)

* **Q** - Medics (revive 1 card from the player's discard pile, has a value of 5 points and placed in the opponents field, as well as adding to your opponent's current round score)

###Modifiers and Nullifiers

If a row modifier is played, then each card in the modifier's color row is worth a value of 1 point instead of their number value.

If another modifier is placed, then it replaces the effect of the existing modifier, which is placed in the side pile.

If a nullifier is placed, it replaces the current modifier and also goes into the side pile.

A modifier can even be placed on a modifier if it has the same effect.

A nullifier can be played even if there are no modifier cards on the field.

###Spies and Medics

All face cards are worth 5 points for the opposing player. They are played on the enemy's side of the field in their respective color row.

A spy card allows the player to draw 1 card.

A medic card, however, allows the player to revive one value or spy card from their discard pile and place it in the color row.

A spy and a medic can also be played on your side of the field, but are only worth 3 points.
