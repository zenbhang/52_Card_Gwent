## Introduction (v1.02)


**Spies and Medics** is a card game that takes its influence from a variety of historical to contemporary sources.
From archaic War to modern *Witcher 3*, **Spies and Medics** is an unique amalgamation of a love child and an homage to old and new card games.

### Phases

* Coin Flip -> Draft Phase -> Turn Phase

### Drafting
As determined by the coin toss, whoever drafts first must discard one card from their hand, then draw one from the deck. After doing so, the other player discards and draws.

* The first player discards and draws again.

* The other player discards, then draws once more.

* All cards discarded in the drafting phase go into the side pile.

* After the drafting phase is done, the first turn can begin.

### Rounds
* The player who drafted second, places the first card.

* During each turn, a player can play one card or pass.

* If a player passes, they won't be able to put down a card until the next round.

* The remaining player can play as many cards as they want until they also pass.

* Whoever has the highest point value, after both players pass, wins the round.

* If a player wins the first round, they draw 2 cards and their opponent draws 1 card.

* If a player wins the second round but the match hasn't ended, then they draw 3 cards and their opponent draws 2 cards.

* If a round ends in a draw, then both players draw 2 cards.

* When a round ends, all cards on each player's side of the field will go into their respective discard pile regardless of original ownership.

* The score is set to 0 on both sides once a round ends.

* All modifiers and side cards go to the side pile.

* For the next round, the player that went second previously, goes first.

## Cards

* **Aces** - Modifiers

* **2**- Modifiers

* **3**- Nullify

* **4 -> 10** - Value Cards

* **J and K** - Spies (draw 1, has a value of 5 and is placed in the opponents field, as well as adding to your opponent's current round score)

* **Q** - Medics (revive 1 card from the player's discard pile, has a value of 5 and placed in the opponents field, as well as adding to your opponent's current round score)

### Modifiers and Nullifies
* If a Row Modifier is played, then each card in the Modifier's color row is worth a value of 1 instead of their number value.

* If another Modifier is placed, then it replaces the effect of the existing Modifier which is placed in the side pile.

* If a Nullify is placed, it replaces the current Modifier and also goes into the side pile.

* A Modifier can even be placed on a Modifier if it has the same effect.

* A Nullify can be played even if there is no Modifier on the field.

### **Spies and Medics**
* All face cards are worth a value of 5 for the opposing player.

* They are played on the enemy's side of the field in their respective color row.

* A Spy allows the player that plays it to draw 1 card.

* A Medic allows the player that plays it to revive 1 value or Spy card from their discard pile and place it just as they were from their hand.

* A Spy and a Medic can also be played on your side of the field, but are only worth 3 points.
